Ingenie Designs Wordpress Theme

The Ingenie Designs Wordpress Theme was built out of frustration at abandoned wordpress themes, and themes that heavily integrated abandoned plugins. The Ingenie Designs Theme is built to be basic, and secure. The Ingenie Designs Theme does not give you a fancy looking theme out of the box, but it does give you a secure canvas for you to design your own Wordpress site on. 

The Ingenie Designs Theme is built using the Bootstrap 4 framework. The theme has Woocommerce support, header image, site-tag and other basic Wordpress functionality that you would expect in a Wordpress Theme. 

The Theme has successfully been deployed on a number of commercial websites including https://rebelradical-diy.co.uk, https://colour-burst.com https://bodymania.co.uk, https://lmc-trackers.co.uk and https://ingeniedesigns.co.uk

There's currently no "roadmap" for this Theme. The Theme is updated by client request, with all changes being merged. Future updates will focus on the out of the box experience, and come bundled with a guide that details the best way to use the theme.
